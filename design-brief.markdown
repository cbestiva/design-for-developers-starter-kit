## The key users.

Noel will need to be able to update the site's content on his own.
New clients will browse the site for the services S&S provides. They will expect to see helpful information and links regarding the law.

## Scenarios in which your app or site will be used.
*These should be short narratives of the above users with your app / site. (One sentence each)*
